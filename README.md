# Automatic Phylogenetic Tree

In this project, we aim to automate the creation and visualization of a phylogenetic tree based on a species input by the user. Our goal is to make the process of creating such trees more efficient and accessible, allowing for for deeper insights into evolutionary relationships within the animal kingdom.
